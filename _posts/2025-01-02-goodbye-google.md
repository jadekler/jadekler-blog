# A goodbye to Google

I left Google last month, after almost 7 years to the day.

This comes from a desire to switch to remote work, which lets my wife, kids, and
I move closer to our family.

In my farewell letter to the team, I indulged in a bit of a tradition of writing
a retrospective. I don't think I'll do so here, but I thought it was worth
putting a marker in ~the sand~ my blog all the same.

I will share the last paragraph, though:

> I've been incredibly lucky to be surrounded by phenomenal managers, team
leads, and incredibly talented peers. I'm indelibly grateful [to each of them].
It has been an immense privilege and pleasure working and learning from [them].

Working at Google the past 7 years has been a total dream, and I've learned an
immense amount from the challenges I've been lucky enough to work on, and moreso
the peers I've been able to work with.

## A hello to Netflix

All that said, I am also very excited for my next chapter at Netflix. I've heard
great things about the work that's done at Netflix and look forward to see
another way to do things, apply some of the things I've learned, and no doubt
learn a great deal from the next set of challenges and great colleagues.
